# Cert-Utils
Cert utils provides some useful utilities to manipulate and use certificates generated by cert-manager.

1. Ability to populate route certificates
2. Ability to create java keystore and truststore from the certificates
3. Ability to show info regarding the certificates
4. Ability to alert when a certificate is about to expire
5. Ability to inject ca bundles in Secrets, ConfigMaps, ValidatingWebhookConfiguration, MutatingWebhookConfiguration CustomResourceDefinition and APIService objects

The functionality is achieved through annotations.

Currently its only used within the OTP pattern to take certificates generated by cert-manager for vault and update the vault routes to use those certificates to secure TLS.
